## ⛓ Smart Contract

The crowdfunding platform is powered by a smart contract deployed on the _**Sepolia Ethereum Testnet**_. The smart contract is written in Solidity and contains the main business logic of the platform. It has the following main features:

1. **Create Campaign:** Allows a user to create a new crowdfunding campaign with specific details like title, description, target amount, deadline, and an image.
2. **Donate:** Allows a user to donate Ether to a specific campaign.
3. **Get Campaigns:** Retrieves all the campaigns created on the platform.
4. **Get User Campaigns:** Retrieves campaigns created by a specific user.
5. **Get Donations:** Retrieves all the donations made to a specific campaign.
6. **Withdraw Funds:** Allows the campaign owner to see the collected funds and relevant cash-out information.

## 👨‍💻 Website Capabilities

The website serves as the frontend for the crowdfunding platform and interacts with the smart contract. The website's main features include:

1. **Home:** Displays a list of all crowdfunding campaigns available on the platform.
2. **Profile:** Shows user's campaigns.
3. **Create Campaign:** Allows a user to create a new crowdfunding campaign by providing the necessary details.
4. **Campaign Details:** Displays the details of a specific campaign, including its donations and the ability to donate.
5. **Payment:** Allows a user to donate to a specific campaign.
6. **Withdraw:** Displays relevant cash-out information and how much the user has collected from their campaigns in total.

## 📝 Key Points

1. The project makes use of the `@thirdweb-dev/react` library, which simplifies interactions with Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.
2. The `StateContext` is used to manage global state and provide easy access to the smart contract's functions throughout the application.
3. The project follows a modular approach, with custom components such as `Navbar`, `Sidebar`, `CustomButton`, `FormField`, and `FundCard` to improve code readability and maintainability.
4. The website is designed with a responsive layout to provide a good user experience on various devices and screen sizes.

In summary, this crowdfunding platform is a well-structured and feature-rich application that demonstrates the potential of decentralized finance and blockchain technology. By leveraging smart contracts and the Ethereum network, it offers a secure, transparent, and efficient way for users to create and participate in crowdfunding campaigns.
